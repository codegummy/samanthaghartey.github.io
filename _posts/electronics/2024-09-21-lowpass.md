A low-pass filter is an electronic circuit that allows low-frequency signals to pass through while blocking or reducing higher-frequency signals. It's commonly used in audio processing, radio communications, and various signal-processing applications to remove unwanted noise or high-frequency interference. By filtering out these higher frequencies, a low-pass filter ensures that only the desired, smoother signal remains, making it useful for applications that require a clear, steady output, like audio equipment or data signals in digital devices.
